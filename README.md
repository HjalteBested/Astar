# Astar
A* pathfinding algorithm (a.k.a. A* search algorithm) written in C++

This is an widely used pathfinding and searching algorithm; learn more about A* at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).

This implementation is heavily based on Makito Sumi's version found here: [GitHub](https://github.com/SumiMakito/A-star). I have changed alot of the structure in the code and implemented Astar as a class. Furthermore, I have fixed some problems with the scaling of the heuristic function and added AMITS tie-breaker as an option, see: [breaking-ties](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#breaking-ties).

OpenCV is not necessarily required, provided that you have found another way to convert input images into arrays which have the same format used in the example.

### Map samples

[Map 50px 1](assets/Map50_1.bmp) | [Map 50px 2](assets/Map50_2.bmp) | [Map 50px 3](assets/Map50_3.bmp)
------------ | ------------- | -------------
![Map 50px 1](assets/Map50_1.bmp) | ![Map 50px 2](assets/Map50_2.bmp) | ![Map 50px 3](assets/Map50_3.bmp)

### Previews

> **DO NOT** use images below as input images, they have been scaled up for better visual effect.

Input | Output
------------ | -------------
![Input](assets/Map50_1_Out.png) | ![Output](assets/Map50_1_Path.png)
![Input](assets/Map50_2_Out.png) | ![Output](assets/Map50_2_Path.png)
![Input](assets/Map50_3_Out.png) | ![Output](assets/Map50_3_Path.png)
